# RoboFriends

Fun Project done using React and Redux for State Management and Asynchronous actions for API Requests.

This project uses robohash api(https://robohash.org/) to genereate the Robot images dynamically.It uses react's props and states concepts deeply. To run this in your Pc you need to have npm installed. If you have installed npm then you need to cd to this Project Directory and run npm install. This command will download the dependecy files. And also you need to have create-react-app module Use npm install -g create-create-app. After installation use npm start. Then it launches the webpage.

I have also used Json PlaceHolder api a fake REST API(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) to fetch the usernames,email etc from the server.

And also I have added a build file that is used for the deployement. The build file is created using Babel,WebPack that transpiles, minifies and complies the code for a better performance.

I have deloyed this website(https://robotfriends.surge.sh) using surge.sh a CLI that allows you to deploy your projects for free. And also used Github Pages for deploying this react app. I will link an article(https://medium.freecodecamp.org/surge-vs-github-pages-deploying-a-create-react-app-project-c0ecbf317089) that helps you to make your website online.
